git config sets signature for everything pushed to github 
git init sets up new repository 
really easy stuff

set up package manager “brew” and “npm” and maybe another one… and how these stack up against each other in priority, e.g. our local bin vs. the pre-installed apple packages

command line programs like “echo”, “history”, “less” 

set up our own deployment environment “Surge” 

looked at environment variables and how they are generally configured

learned to pipe the output of one program to another using the “|” symbol.
for creating a new file or overwriting one with the same name use “>”. to append information to a specific file use “>>”

flags can be looked up for a command using the “man” command “man [command]” 

commands can be shrunk to shorthand forms
